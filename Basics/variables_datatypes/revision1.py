a=int(input("Enter first number: "),)
b=int(input("Enter second number: "),)
sum=a+b
print("The sum of",a,"and",b,"is",sum)
# This program takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum.
# It then prints the results in a formatted string.
product=a*b
print("the product of the two numbers is",product)
#moreover it calculates the product of thhe two number and prints it in same manner.
diff=a-b
print("the diffrence of the two numbers is ",diff)
#Also, it meassures the diffrence bitween the two numbers and execute it .
division=a/b
print("the divion of the entered numbers is ",division)
#Finally, it divides the first number by the second and displays the result.
modulus=a%b
print("the modulus of the number , enetred by user is ",modulus)
#It is used to calculate the remainder , when first number is divided by the second one.
power=a**b
print("a raise to the power b is ",power)
#this operater highly used to find power of any number .

#In  all these operation i practiced diffrent arithematic opertaion in python using two numbers enetred by the user
#these are the operation that i should know as a programmer , on daily to daily  basis of life.
